# SkyblockPlus (Temp name)
## What is it?
SkyblockPlus is a bot to help users in Hypixel Skyblock (A Minecraft server) currently it offers calculators to see how many runs/bosses will be needed and most importantly, how long it will take
## What's the point in making this?
From what I could see no one really has made a discord bot with calculators for slayers or dungeons and that's what motivated me to make this, I've been wanting to make another Discord bot for a long time now and this is just the perfect thing since I have learnt a lot about JS
## What commands are their?
CataCalc, SlayerCalc, Link, Support, Linkinfo, Help
